        <h1>Meet Cindy</h1>
        <p>In 2013, I started my first Air BnB listing with $1,000 and an air mattress in my living room. I had no idea what I was doing and I never expected it to become my passion. Since then, I became a SuperHost in 2014, created 4 independent listings including one of the first listings to be on the Air BNB Plus platform, maintained a 90-95% occupancy rate, and have helped others create and manage their own Air BnB listings. Every host has the potential to be a great host with a highly-sought after listing.</p>
